• - Investigated invite delivery issues in backgammon-vanilla and compared with the working backgammon project.
  - Added WebSocket messaging security config and invite service/controller wiring earlier; found the main issue was
    destination/identity mismatch (using userId/null vs email).
  - Switched invite routing to be email-based:
      - InviteMessage now includes inviteeEmail/inviterEmail.
      - InviteResponseMessage now includes inviterEmail.
      - GameController builds email-aware invite/response payloads.
      - InviteService publishes invites/responses to /topic/invites/{email}.
      - dashboard.html subscribes to /topic/invites/{currentUserEmail} and handles both invites (confirm dialog → POST /
        invite/respond) and responses (alerts) filtering by current userId.
  - Added UserService.findById helper.
  - Still need confirmation of end-to-end behavior after these changes; if issues persist, verify STOMP connection, CSRF
    token, and that emails are non-null.

stompjs is a JavaScript client library for the STOMP messaging protocol. It lets browsers or Node apps speak STOMP
  over WebSockets (or SockJS) to brokers/servers that support STOMP (e.g., RabbitMQ with STOMP plugin, ActiveMQ, Spring’s
  WebSocket/STOMP support). It gives you a simple API to connect, subscribe to destinations, and send messages, handling
  frames, heartbeats, and reconnection logic.
